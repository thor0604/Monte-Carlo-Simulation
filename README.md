# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Estimate of the value of pi using Monte Carlo's method and visualise the evoluation of the process
This folder contains two programs: approximate_pi.py and draw.py

## approximate_pi.py
This program takes in one integer n as argument. It then estimate the value of pi using n randomly-generated points by applying Monte-Carlo's method. It returns a float.

## draw.py
This program generates a GIF made up of 10 PPM images generated at each 1/10th interval during Monte-Carlo simulation. We can then visualise the evolution of the process. It returns a GIF and 10 PPM images which can be found in the same folder where this program is located.
